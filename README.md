# Dicery

This is NOT to be used in production yet. Once it will be ready for these kind of stuff, this text will magically disappear.

## Overview

Dicery makes roll building and parsing easy. It also has a way to customize roll syntax to make it suitable to you.

## Future

- **Small**: light as hell
- **Real**: Simulate precise random
- **Secure**: Written in TypeScript and has 100% test coverage
- **Customizable**: Roll parser with customizable syntax
- **Extendable**: Code base is modular and allows easy maintainment and extensibility
- **Do one thing well** ðŸ”¥

## Install

[Node.js 12.4+](https://node.green/#ES2019) is required.

```sh
pnpm i dicery
```

## Contribution

Issues... There will be lots of issues...

## Donate

Ehm... Once some of goals of the library will be reached, I'll think of donations. Currently, It's bunch of TypeScript files built by Rollup.js.
